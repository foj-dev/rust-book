# A code journey, together.

Rust is known for its speed, safety, and ability to prevent compile-time bugs. But where to start? The official book is excellent, but sometimes all we want is to get straight to the point.

That's why this book exists.

It was created to facilitate your introduction to the language, regardless of your knowledge level. It's the bridge between complex theory and functional code. The approach is simple: less theory, more practice. Here you'll find the essence of Rust in bite-sized doses, followed by numerous examples, questions, and projects that will solidify each new concept.

This isn't a reference guide; it's a guide for your journey. Get ready to build amazing things and discover why Rust is the language that's revolutionizing the way we program.

Shall we start coding?
