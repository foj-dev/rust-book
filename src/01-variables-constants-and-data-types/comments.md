# Comments

Comments are used to document your code, making it more understandable for you and other developers. They
 are ignored by the compiler, meaning they don't affect how your program runs, only its readability.

- **Clarity:** use them to explain something complex or important.
- **Maintenance:** make it easier to work with your code in the future.
- **Collaboration:** create comments that are understandable to anyone.
- **Debugging:** temporarily disable a line or block of code for testing.

`//`

```rust
// This is a single-line comment.
```
