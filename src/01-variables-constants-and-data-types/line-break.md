# Line break

Line breaks are used when you want to improve text formatting.

`println!`

```rust
// used to print something and then move to a new line.
println!("Whats is your name?");
println!("  ");
println!("My name is Rodolfo!");
```

`\n`

```rust
// used to insert a new line character anywhere within the text.
println!("What is your name?\nMy name is Rodolfo!");
```
